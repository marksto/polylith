  --------------
  payer  .  x  t
  user   .  .  x
  util   .  .  .
  cli    x  .  .

  In this example, payer uses user from the src context, and util from
  the test context (indicated by 't'). user uses util and cli uses payer.
  Each usage comes from at least one :require statement in the brick.

  Example:
    poly deps
    poly deps :swap-axes
    poly deps out:deps.txt
